### Overview <hr>
The aim of this project is to develop a website targeted at adults who wish to learn Spanish and aquire some cultural and local knowledge along the way. This is a fictitious company that specialises in language immersion as a means of learning Spanish in a fun and dynamic environment, while holidaying in the beautiful city of Granada, Spain. The website
will provide information on how this can be acheived through total immersion in Spanish life, while outlining the variety of options available,
such as length of course, accomodation, cultural activities, the buddy system and details regardiing our teaching method and philosophy.
 
### UX <hr>
#### Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to utilise the skills developed throughout the first three modules of the course to develop a fully functioning static website, which is useful, useable and valuable.
Both the visual and navigational elements of the site need to be user friendly and accessible. 

#### User Goals

* To find information about the company, and language immersion in a straighforward and simple manner.

* To know the price of the courses offered and what is included in this price.

* To discover why these courses differ from others and what can be achieved by signing up. 

* To be able to book directly from the site, courses and accomodation included.

* The opportunity to read testimonials and view a gallery of photos to give a clearer idea of how the trip will be.

* Find more information on the courses and activities by clicking onto the instagram, facebook, trip adviser and twitter links provided.

#### User Stories

* As a potential customer, I would like to find all the info I need and the booking options available without complications.

* As a newbie to the Spanish language, I'm keen to find out if the courses offered suit total beginners.

* As a language and tourism student, I'm wondering if the courses will be beneficial to me while working towards my degree.

* As someone who has a keen interest in history and Spanish culture I'd like to know how much of this is included in the program. So that I can decide if it's right for me.

*  As a retired person who is not interested in the adventure activities I want to see the other options available to me before I make a decision.

* As a lanuguage teacher in Ireland, I want to create a budget for a group of ten adult students, and hope the online booking platform can assist me in this.

* As a person of reduced mobility, the site needs to show the options available to me, so I know this company will provide me with suitable accomodation, accessible learning conditions, transport options etc.

#### Site Owner Goals

* Design a site which represents the services offered and will appeal to the target market using appropriate colour schemes, imagery, typography and useful information.

* Ensure the site is easy to navigate and all information can be found by visitors within seconds.

* Engage postential customers by outlining why the services are unique, trustworthy and valuable.

* Increase website traffic from the target audience using tools such as google analytics, blogging and social media.

* Generate leads by asking visitors to subscribe to a monthly newsletter.

* Produce a site which is easily accessible on all sizes, mobile devices and browsers.

#### User Requirements and expectations

* A fast loading time.

* A website which is clear and easy to navigate.

* Recognisable format, no surprises.

* A well designed, aesthetically pleasing user interface.

* The ability to make a decision based on site content.

* A means to contact business owners directly for a more personal experience.

### DESIGN <hr>

#### DESIGN CHOICES

#### COLOURS

I chose this color scheme as it reflects the environment in which the company is based. The pinkish hues of the clay on many of the old buildings mixed with the dark green foliage surrounding them. I had planned on making more use of the yellow colour seen here but in the end it didn't really fir in with the content and the style I was trying to convey.

- ![#dbb238](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dbb238/000000?text=+) `#dbb238`

#### FONTS

The fonts I have chosen to use are Josefin Sans and Lato with sans-serif as a backup font. I chose Josefin Sans due to the elegant style and vintage feel, which I think represents the city in which the school is based. I thought Lato was a good match as it's simplicity and elegance.

#### IMAGES

I have used many images throughout the site to attract potential customers and covey the message that this is a holiday as well as an opportunity to learn the language. 
The images used were downloaded from https://unsplash.com/ which is a source of freely useable, fully licenced images. Credits for each image can be found below in the [CREDITS](#credits) section.
