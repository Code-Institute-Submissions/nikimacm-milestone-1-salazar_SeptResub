such as length of course, accomodation, cultural activities, the buddy system and details regardiing our teaching method and philosophy.
 
### UX <hr>
#### Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to utilise the skills developed throughout the first three modules of the course to develop a fully functioning static website, which is useful, useable and valuable.
Both the visual and navigational elements of the site need to be user friendly and accessible. 

#### User Goals

* To find information about the company, and language immersion in a straighforward and simple manner.

* To know the price of the courses offered and what is included in this price.

* To discover why these courses differ from others and what can be achieved by signing up. 

* To be able to book directly from the site, courses and accomodation included.

* The opportunity to read testimonials and view a gallery of photos to give a clearer idea of how the trip will be.

* Find more information on the courses and activities by clicking onto the instagram, facebook, trip adviser and twitter links provided.

#### User Stories

* As a potential customer, I would like to find all the info I need and the booking options available without complications.

* As a newbie to the Spanish language, I'm keen to find out if the courses offered suit total beginners.

* As a language and tourism student, I'm wondering if the courses will be beneficial to me while working towards my degree.

* As someone who has a keen interest in history and Spanish culture I'd like to know how much of this is included in the program. So that I can decide if it's right for me.

*  As a retired person who is not interested in the adventure activities I want to see the other options available to me before I make a decision.

* As a lanuguage teacher in Ireland, I want to create a budget for a group of ten adult students, and hope the online booking platform can assist me in this.

* As a person of reduced mobility, the site needs to show the options available to me, so I know this company will provide me with suitable accomodation, accessible learning conditions, transport options etc.
